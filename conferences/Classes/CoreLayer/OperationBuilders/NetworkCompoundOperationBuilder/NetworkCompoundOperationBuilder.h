 This builder is used to create typical network operations, which consist of the following steps:
 - NSURLRequest configuration using the provided parameters
 - NSURLRequest signing with some authentication data
 - Sending NSURLRequest to the remote server and receiving data back
 - Deserializing raw response data
 - Validating the deserialized data
 - Mapping the deserialized data to custom models
 
 Either of this steps can be skipped.
